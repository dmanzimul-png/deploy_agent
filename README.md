Automated Attendance Tracker Setup

This project contains a shell script that automatically creates the required directory structure for the attendance tracker. The script generates all necessary folders and files, allows the user to update attendance thresholds, and checks if Python3 is installed before finishing.

How to Run

Make the script executable:

chmod +x setup_project.sh


Then run:

./setup_project.sh


Follow the prompts to enter a project name.

Archive Feature

If the script is interrupted using Ctrl + C, it automatically archives the current project folder and deletes the incomplete directory to keep the workspace clean.
